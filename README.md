Code for the Advent of code programming challenge https://adventofcode.com/2020

In order to install some of the modules required for some of the perl files, you will need to run this code in the terminal.  This will install the modules into your system so perl can use them.
```
$ sudo perl -MCPAN -e shell

...
cpan[1]> install List::MoreUtils

```
